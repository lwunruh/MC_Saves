open-source, and community-driven translations for ALL Minecraft mods.","body":"# _Loqui's development is paused until I have the time and resources to properly maintain this project._\n\n### **_Loqui depends on community contributions, please help us translate at [Loqui's Translation Project](https://loqui.imb11.dev/)_**\n\n[![](https://github.com/IMB11/Loqui/raw/master/lokalise_badge.png)](https://lokalise.com/solutions/for-managers)\n\n# Loqui\n\nThe goal of Loqui is to provide free, open-source, and community-driven translations for ALL Minecraft mods.\n\n*A NeoForge port is planned, but the current goal is to smooth out any significant bugs and issues that may happen.*\n\n## For Users\n\nSimply drop Loqui into your mods folder, and it will download any translations you need from the Loqui API, it's that simple!\n\n## For Modpack Developers\n\nAgain, include Loqui in your modpack and you can allow your users to play in their native language!\n\nIt's recommended you encourage your community to join the [Translation Project](https://loqui.imb11.dev/) in order to improve the quality and quantity of translations - the more the merrier!\n\n## For Mod Developers\n\nA system is currently being developed that will allow mod developers to download translations from the Loqui API and bundle them directly into their mods.\n\nLoqui has an intelligent algorithm that allows translations to be accurate across versions, and ignore any existing translations your mod may provide!\n\n## Benefits\n\n- **Crowdsourced translations** - Get your mod translated by the community for free, all translations are moderated by verified proofreaders.\n- **Automatic updates** - No need to manually update translations, Loqui will do it for you.\n- **Ability to download translations** - You can download the translations from Crowdin and bundle them directly in your mod if you wish.\n\n## Technical Explanation\n\n- Loqui traverses your mods folder, gathering information on mods and what `en_us.json` files are present.\n- It then sends this information to the Loqui API, which returns any translations that are available, and indexes any new unrecognized `en_us.json` files it recieves so that the community can translate them.\n- Loqui then downloads these translations and places them in the correct location.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Loqui Website](https://loqui.imb11.dev/).\n\n## Opt-out\n\nOpting out can be useful if:\n\n- You already provide crowd-sourced translations.\n- You have a custom translation system.\n- You don't want your mod to be translated.\n\nIf you wish to opt-out of Loqui, you can do so by adding a `noloqui.txt` file to your mod's resources directory.\n\nEg: `assets/namespace/noloqui.txt` would disable loqui for any language files within the `namespace` namespace.\n\nIf you wish to have your mod removed from Loqui entirely - including any `en_us.json` files that have been pre-indexed, please contact me directly.\n","published":"2024-04-09T16:54:06.341758Z","updated":"2024-04-22T20:14:52.875171Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":95033,"followers":46,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":["library"],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["e6k73r7u","rOcGnAeK"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cMpxLYTx/f4ff552522c79cece9f863000e4c547d9ce73b27_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"rOcGnAeK","project_id":"cMpxLYTx","author_id":"bOHH0P9Z","featured":true,"name":"Loqui

href=\"https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immediatelyfast\"><img src=\"https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_686911_downloads.svg\"></a>\n\n  <p>ImmediatelyFast is an open source Minecraft mod which improves the immediate mode rendering performance of the client.\n  <br />It is designed to be lightweight and compatible with other mods.</p>\n</div>\n\n## Optimizations\nImmediatelyFast generally optimizes all immediate mode rendering by using a custom buffer implementation which batches\ndraw calls and uploads data to the GPU in a more efficient way.  \nThe following parts of the immediate mode rendering code are optimized:\n\n- Entities\n- Block entities\n- Particles\n- Text rendering\n- GUI/HUD\n- Immediate mode rendering of other mods\n\nIt also features targeted optimizations where vanilla rendering code is being changed in order to run faster.  \nThe following parts of the rendering code are optimized with a more efficient implementation:\n\n- Map rendering\n- HUD rendering\n- Text rendering\n\n## Performance\nHere are some performance comparisons of areas the mod optimizes particularly well:\n\nIf other mods are listed in the table this means that this mod also optimizes that part of the game.\n\nTest Hardware: Ryzen 5 1600, 32GB DDR4, GTX 1060\n\nFPS Numbers were taken from external tools (in this case MSI Afterburner) and averaged over a couple of seconds.  \nIf you decide to test this yourself keep in mind that ImmediatelyFast can only improve FPS in a scenario where your CPU\nis the bottleneck (Most likely the case if your GPU isn't ancient or you use very

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling.

Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-09-14T16:14:08.775535Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6890337,"followers":3221,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv","yvWntDTo","4vJjL6YG","95DrIgKD","7qhkYutC","9BeU4JMZ","DOvpgsS7","3DUWVimm","GCiXd1DU","lfYHLBCj","HuiMDCpB","KneJBt8W","dVfrkFFQ","rfh88j45","bwjbN1G7","kakr6cxQ","IzAfhCj5","rGuR7oQZ","fMRe5pGZ","652AHAwn","2hVd4znq","bCmmruN5","F1JjnEjo","mWAFiRcK","wa38cdv3","SfWhB6Bd","7bxh2EoP","aFlca15F","up2Xg2sy","jVIxXxpT","dzyn3ag2","mtJzKD3q","ORJKgPNp","rD5uCHNg","khwkB6ra","BitxFUOE","K0xj45PZ","9xVJZ8Xr","xvYCCPha","cqKSqPQH","gpqniM0d","QWCOTizL","ch6lB4Mh","ZBKoFavY","nAaR07o2","JN7NY56L","at9xKHYT","9PuZ3Kv1","sZcSLicd","S7FrTSoe","nYfJt8sH","OUq3XNDY","5SZ2FbHC","BzcsKF0w","av84l2vE","9BVLcBub","jkLvxFFA","g2i5i750","FTmtYNdf","84vLaMxp","zQC8LMqE","vk0zN6fZ","jRyhNivy","H7gAzW4H","wHepnZI4","38Yn9SZ2","ugKXobOO","DoBtcvMg","BO9AiBm5","UHf5zYNP","aQVIrXgg","iVQqb3JE","9QJQkXQO","FOD8MnMP","TNV0t1vr","xUK1iLCG","ZixDSoU6","YgS4jj90","XcnnBerM","t7AKPYYe","3cpNy8V0","UCckCwKd","jJH2hIKf","VzqipEu3","FW52tJir","7PdWWUFS","OCdB6lFh","pAJPbTr6","2fuWty2a","eIrkcho9","r01y00lj","5hE1VVkN","7Jih1uiK","ZwZs424m","Z36RFcid","f3RkrLlq","tU9R6Yhm","qELXEyUW","rFTf6MGx","hX4kT2fu","Vcc07Cbk","k0JtklvR","Jy4LTMvg","aRPREs3k","vX76pGn2","h6kJM9aB","dFzFc4pQ","a8rleJ9k","qRPBlJGv","BQzSPC9r","xBVsa4PN","RxO5VXam","urnmKTE2","CS5hOL3r","zk0LBc4p","Wpv8HF1Y","1TQbBxot","QJ5osCzi","7lPpjIf2","rI8pyC7J","9SzOk7nB","sCT3eoHN","j2qbZTUF","sFaJ0tp7","T2aAeuXR","k5OAPpQW","ea3GXWH4","hux9vLhA","YSvm2IkM","pCvq1pQB","B3Ugrpyf","Gz7O4WFA","r6YlMxIX","IMIQUYIb","zdqVegqJ","h8OsZS6x","1mO1hvI1","uxoPMszm","eNLcnJ59","k0MZME45","cDpfwwTI","JmxJ7PRU","VXRadQci","Z7vUyAkh","JGkiynD6","PS7IstpT","VGqmhREJ","IiUIuAQ8","mThwcg0b","JQYNJXBZ","GE6rKKNl","PJfkndPN","TKtKf5Ox","eSJf7faJ","GmYfTotf","oDvkeij1","gSpBlPRv","N5MDB0qv","JhcS2HbG","1L65wrUr","2uaNS0xI","BrrclpJQ","cZVaCCKm","LzyUTRVY","n415h7ar","P02JnZBV","eIaal2Yv","L8H24hW7","RtWSn79j","gxkUEYca","SwaXdYpi","QoWmvvjv","LQgTJZDC","Ou8zOCkh","pMWpMW2a","1AgxXQlg","9I3c8Kck","9WGdSFwb","8cCInac0","nC70iPAg","TkjKemrg","CXTokXdd","gijBk6cS","Qql6TI9W"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/6e5bbd0d06b1741bfdab6c0cfab6de8fdaf0064c_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"up2Xg2sy","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 2.0","version_number":"2.0","changelog":"- texture overrides now give the `missing texture` texture if the texture wasn't found instead of not applying\n- fixed first person hand jittering with certain player animation resource-packs\n- added the `ifb() randomb() catch()` animation functions\n  - `ifb()` is a boolean returning version of `if()` \n  - `randomb()` is a boolean returning version of `random()`\n  - `catch(x, c, id)` is a new debug function that will always return `x` unless it had an error in which case it will return `c`. `id` is optional and will make the function print the reason `c` was returned to the log with this `id` to identify the printout\n- added the `is_jumping` `is_swimming` `is_gliding` `is_right_handed` animation variables\n- added the `modelRule modelSuffix var varb global_var global_varb` random properties\n- removed the restriction on entity variables making them only accessible from the declaring model *(OptiFine parity)* *(wolf_collar.jem can now correctly access variables set by wolf.jem on the same wolf)*\n- added a model display to the model list in the gui to see the model before exporting its .jem file\n\n- added attachment points\n- added arrow & spectral_arrow model support\n- added new model parts listed in `OptiFine 1.20.4_HD_U_I8_pre3`\n- added variables `distance` `is_blocking` `is_crawling` `height_above_ground` `fluid_depth` `fluid_depth_down` `fluid_depth_up`\n- added Global variables, they are specified in the format \"global_var.<name>\" (float) or \"global_varb.<name>\" (boolean), they are shared by all mobs and block entities and allow more technical things like counting entities\n- improved rule_index, now correctly applies 0 when no rule is met\n- fixed the `cannot inherit from final class` forge crash returning in v1.3\n- moved the variant property into ETF\n- fixed crash `.jem failed to load java.lang.NullPointerException: Cannot read the array length because \"textureSize\" is null`\n- added the model file name to crash messages where it was missing\n- added `sizeAdd` to the emf model exporting\n- the emf model exporting now does 2 export log passes for each model with known OptiFine part names, one pass with, and one without the OptiFine part names. The one without might reveal some extra parts, that do not get used by OptiFine, or have been added by mods \n- EMF model part boxes may now additionally declare `sizeAddX sizeAddY sizeAddZ`, as opposed to just `sizeAdd` with OptiFine, for per axis model inflation. `sizeAdd` will still work as before, though will be overridden if the others are present.\n- added OptiFine part name definitions for `breeze`, `breeze_eyes`, `breeze_wind`, `wind_charge`\n- fixed case where \"!(arms.visible)\" works but \"!arms.visible\" doesn't in 1.3\n- the directory format for modded models has been changed from `assets/minecraft/optifine/cem/modded/<namespace>/<modelname>.jem` to `assets/<namespace>/optifine/cem/<modelname>.jem`\n  - the old directory with the /modded/ folder is still supported for now but is considered deprecated \n  - this change makes things more consistent with modded name spaces\n  - the `emf/cem/` directory is also valid in these namespaces as well as the ability to put the `<modelname>.jem` file within a folder of the same name, such as `cem/<modelname>/<modelname>.jem`\n- added a setting for the animation distance LOD setting, to now factor in an entities size to affect larger entities less\n- fixed a crash when methods were directly inverted e.g `!between(....)`\n- failed animation expressions will now resolve to `0` when applied to a model part or variable *(OptiFine parity)*\n- supports ETF's new config screen builder\n  - added a category `Animation math details` which lists and explains all functions and variables registered to the animation math system\n  - added a category `All models` which allows applying certain settings per .jem file as well as selectively disable the loading of certain models\n  - moved a few settings, mostly for the distance LOD, into the new category `performance settings`\n  - added settings into the `per entity settings` category to allows applying certain settings to only those entities\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-19T20:45:11.492951Z","downloads":56632,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"f4e3382cdba85cb74e90091ed6071c506517e15383021ab86d902cd6d9c052cab254a1fe659fbc6a8019951b1405578444970b0da56499afc2c684df6b61370b","sha1":"54822a000da2917db26e3b74836aa773ede12f7d"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/versions/up2Xg2sy/entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.4-2.0.jar","filename":"entity_model_features_fabric_1.20.4-2.0.jar","primary":true,"size":383171,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"BVzZfTc1","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXLgMy6f","user":{"id":"rLbuLV6t","username":"Traben","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8456487?v=4","bio":"What even is OptiFine?","created":"2022-01-26T01:51:52.290422Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"9WGdSFwb","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"Fabric -

visible. [Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not. During the rendering, the not visible ones will be skipped the same way entities behind you are.\n\n[![Shockbyte](https://tr7zw.dev/img/shockbyte_black.png?v=2)](https://shockbyte.com//partner/tr7zw)\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- none\n\n## Incompatible\n\n- none (With some mods you might need to add the blocks to the config whitelist to fix visual issues)\n\n## Tested with\n\n- Sodium\n- Iris\n- Optifine\n \n## Note to why it works even with Sodium/Optifine\n\nThis has been tested with other mods, Optifine(Optifabric), Iris, and Sodium, in all cases resulting in fps gains in places like Game Server lobbies.\n\nYou might wonder why it does increase the FPS with Sodium since Sodium has \"Use Entity Culling\" in its Advanced settings and enabled by default. The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-08-28T18:56:00.585754Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":13391279,"followers":6472,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F","DHBIGCNn","F3RXDl1W","TOyoOLwn","7ZgGD02s","KRGWwoZW","1LVdHUaX","3VAtIiWX","cj8nR3eG","VgDjay7P","p2L3IXut","6U5rh26a","Gggee1My","LXLEbjiC","Bu3hSiJb","KGMvyJTe","mahLIqpj","haJ4L3vJ","lil4k3tE","7F6Kp0Ay","HZeMEZEy","vg0SC4Y7","xWH6Uo7w","iqty9WKv","opQrd8FA","17GdZTv7","iVUgWfyD","VgprkY4E","uh3DtMnM","9OiMQqUE","rWxSnbQW","USSckz12","nLlovYRU","dlg7nMa6","1JrKE0F6","q0jula9L","uYs3FOuQ","DbsD7DRt","2GnM6hql","SMIhog68","hyG3PpKt","bTufFvSs","RlFFB3Eb","EDlaQvPy","dJTijYHW","RpWp3udp","kPbJu8eF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/7873452d6cede4daed12da3d7d8c193ab88b4fd6_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"7JR5qJ8f","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":false,"name":"1.6.4-1.20.4 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.4-1.20.4","changelog":"## Changes\r\n* Fix culling when the camera is stuck in a wall.

Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

resourcepack features and a GUI to configure OptiFine alternatives more conveniently.","body":"_Context: For a long time, OptiFine has been a big part of Minecraft modding.  \nFor an equal amount of time, it has been causing errors with mods – its closed source nature making it especially hard to work with as a mod developer.  \nFor that reason, a lot of alternatives have been created.  \nBut usually they only replicate one specific feature of OptiFine, meaning the user has to install a lot of mods and configure them by searching for the specific mod in ModMenu._\n\n- The first problem is relatively easy to solve, by either downloading a modpack such as <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized\">Fabulously Optimized</a> or using <a href=\"https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives\">Lambda's fantastic list of alternative mods</a>\n- Puzzle was created to solve the latter by providing a <b>united config for OptiFine replacement mods</b> with built-in support for the most relevant alternatives and an API for other mods to take advantage of.\n- Due to many OptiFine features still having no replacement mod, Puzzle also adds certain OptiFine features on it's own, like <b>resourcepack-provided splash screens</b>\n- We also offer some new, innovative features to resourcepack developers, such as <b>unlocked rotation values</b> and <b>bigger size for JSON-models</b>. <br>The configuration screen can be found in the vanilla options screen, as well as ModMenu. &lrm;\n\n<center>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

with Fabric.\n\nFabric API is the library for essential hooks and interoperability mechanisms for Fabric mods. Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

game logic/server optimization mod","body":"Lithium is a modern, general-purpose optimization mod for Minecraft which works to improve a number of systems (game physics, mob AI, block ticking, etc) with the goal of **not changing any vanilla mechanics**. \n\n<br>\n\nThe mod works **on both the client and server**, and can be installed on servers **without requiring clients to also have the mod** (and vice versa.)\n\n<br>\n\nFor multiplayer servers, administrators can expect a sizeable improvement to tick times, allowing their hardware to support more loaded entities, chunks, and players. Even in single-player, Lithium helps to improve performance by optimizing the internal game server, which is used for \"ticking\" the world. This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-08-11T17:21:31.831246Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":12521609,"followers":11249,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF","g2qXxjsR","fsK2ycFx","OC4JOVBe","my7uONjU","p25IJhj0","5a3sPIH2","NTZCh7rb","5szYtenV"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/bcc8686c13af0143adf4285d741256af824f70b7_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"nMhjKWVE","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

**without having to run a server or setup port forwarding!** In the future, we also plan to support Bedrock Edition clients\nthrough the use of Geyser.\n\n## What if my friend doesn't have the mod installed?\n\nIf your friend doesn't have the mod installed, you cannot use the friends system with them. However, you can run the command `/worldhost ip` to get an IP that can be used with tunneling. Do note, however, that not using the friends system could increase ping. If you don't want the ping increase, you can run `/worldhost tempip` to get a *temporary* server IP that lasts for at least 60 seconds. Clients who connect within the 60 seconds will remain connected. If you plan to never use the friends system, you can disable it in the mod settings.\n\n## How does this mod work?\n\nThis mod has a server that your client connects to, this server is used to communicate with other clients using World Host. \n\n1. When your friend wants to join you, your friend's client asks the server for an IP address to connect to. \n2. The server then asks your client to create a join mode (`JoinType` in the protocol). There are two join mods: UPnP and Proxy. \n3. UPnP mode is tried first. Your client tries to open a temporary port forward in your router that your friends client can use to connect to you directly. \n4. If UPnP succeeds, your client tells the server the port to use, then the server tells your friend's client your IP and the port number. \n5. If UPnP fails, then your client tells the server to use Proxy mode.

[No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)' wording is also technical, biased towards negativity and very detailed.\nThis resource pack fixes both by replacing those phrases with simple and unbiased, yet accurate phrases.\n\n### What this resource pack does\n\n- Change the tooltips on vanilla report buttons and chat indicators\n- Change the \"messages can't be verified\" warning toast\n- Change the \"Only Show Secure Chat\" label and tooltip\n- Change the description on vanilla report textbox\n- Change the status icons and tooltips on [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)\n- Ensures the phrases are short, clear and non-technical\n- [Is available in several languages](https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized)\n- Is an educational tool, not a protective one\n- Focuses on practical use cases and actual server behavior, not theoretical possibilities\n- Serve as an example and call to Mojang to improve transparency and clarity regarding this feature in the game\n\n<details>\n<summary>What this resource pack doesn't do</summary>\n\n- State, whether chat reportability is good or bad\n- Obstruct or mislead the meaning of any phrase\n- Edit the report icon or \"Player reporting\" button\n- Edit report or ban reasons\n- Edit the ban screen\n- Hide vanilla indicators or warning toast\n- Replicate the features of [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) or any other mod or plugin\n\n</details>\n\n### What do the icons mean?\n\nThe icons are only shown when you have [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) installed. For vanilla chat indicators, hover the gray box on the left.\n\n- ![unknown](https://i.ibb.co/Yb1n6fW/unknown.png) - status not yet known, you must send one chat message to get it\n- ![disabled](https://i.ibb.co/QDFzXCT/secure.png) - no chat messages can be reported to Mojang\n- ![optional](https://i.ibb.co/hstcjW7/neutral.png) - most chat messages can be reported to Mojang, but the server does not prefer it and the playing user opts out\n   - In some cases, no messages can be reported but that is not reflected on the icon. You can confirm by seeing if you can report anyone on Social Interactions.\n- ![enabled](https://i.ibb.co/2YgMHpR/insecure.png) - all chat messages can be reported to Mojang\n- ![realms](https://i.ibb.co/gTxw84X/realms.png) - only on Realms: all chat messages can be reported to Mojang and [Mojang is passively monitoring the chat for violations](https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/8047895358605-Our-Commitment-to-Player-Safety#h_01G95X76WR1PM97XBXDE7G25KE)\n\n### Who is this resource pack for\n\n- Users, who don't understand how chat reportability works\n- Users, who don't understand when and where chat reportability works\n- Users, who are positive, neutral or slightly concerned about chat reportability \n- Users, who don't understand the technical terms of vanilla or [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)\n- Modpacks, that have been afraid to include [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) due to potential confusion or bias\n- Modpacks, that want to ensure users know about chat reportability and where it works\n- Parents, who want to ensure their children play on servers that enforce chat reportability\n- Realm owners, who want to know the limitations and requirements of Realms\n- Server owners, who enforce chat reportability and want to ensure users know how it works\n\n### Even more questions\n\n> **Q**: Do I have to use this with [No Chat Reports](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports)?\n>\n> **A**: No, though it is recommended to get more accurate status icons.\n\n> **Q**: Do I have to configure No Chat Reports a certain way to benefit from this?\n>\n> **A:** It has to be enabled and not whitelisting by default to get the indicator icons, any other changes are up to you. You may configure it to skip prompts automatically (set \"Default signing mode\" to \"On Demand\") to make the experience smoother.\n\n> **Q**: Should I install No Chat Reports if I like chat reportability?\n>\n> **A**: Yes, it is still recommended, as it is currently the only way to get a consistent indicator about the system being active on the server. Remember, the mod always respects the server's intent and does not contain any hacks or exploits.\n\n> **Q**: Why is this not in No Chat Reports itself?\n>\n> **A**: No Chat Reports' default phrases do a better job at describing the technical details and giving users traffic light-like indicators to assist on _avoiding_ chat reports. This resource pack is meant to be a more neutral approach similar to [Steam's \"VAC-secured\" indicator](https://i132.photobucket.com/albums/q3/Sierra_Oscar_2006/VAC2w.jpg) - any user can make their own call on whether seeing the shield icon is a bad or good thing. I really hope Mojang will implement something like this in the vanilla game one day.\n> \n> Edit: [Mojang implemented a similar badge](https://findmcserver.com/parents#features) in their new online server list, but not yet in-game and no Java Edition servers have it.\n\n> **Q**: Does this replace every chat reportability-related phrase and icon?\n>\n> **A**: No, only the minimum that is required for clear understanding.\n\n> **Q**: What about skin and username reporting?\n>\n> **A**: As of version 3.0, the pack has been updated to reflect the new reporting selection screen. However, most of the features of this resource pack are still only focused on chat.\n\n> **Q**: I don't see the changed phrase where I should see it.\n>\n> **A**: That might be due to a lack of resource pack translation in your language, so default phrases are displayed as a fallback. [Please contribute!](https://crowdin.com/project/fabulously-optimized)\n\n> **Q**: Can I contribute translations to my language?\n>\n> **A**: Yes, please do!

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-06-16T09:45:34.688950Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":11986791,"followers":6375,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv","7slRrLO6","BkJB5PPB","wmIZ4wP4"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/222a126f26f8f9ae1eb339f3b767677f18bff31f_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"pguEMpy9","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.3 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.3-fabric","changelog":"- Update to Minecraft 1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-13T09:52:24.527613Z","downloads":1319780,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f2bbb773f4213d36201b76820f206e2a6f213c0c","sha512":"709ab6362dd1dcc432edd1e6c33aafba6f2d12be701bc14911107340f8ac2466779c4e57d8a303f0350c46478f23008e6eeca78e4eadedd0bdee63d4ae72ed9a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/pguEMpy9/ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125100,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.3-fabric.jar"},"mods\\yet-another-config-lib-fabric-3.3.2+1.20.4.jar":{"sha512":"597073b3835ce1d4c0f9e4ba835bd565871fa49a8feee41b90213480a76d251e2a57a71729f132e4b908ef50a5602cff90c330da229db605014e26e856cfcbc8","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"1eAoo2KR","slug":"yacl","project_type":"mod","team":"Nwpe87D0","title":"YetAnotherConfigLib","description":"A builder-based configuration library for Minecraft.","body":"# YetAnotherConfigLib\n\n![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)\n[![Java 17](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Java%2017-9B599A.svg?color=orange)](https://www.oracle.com/news/announcement/oracle-releases-java-17-2021-09-14)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/780023008668287017?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://short.isxander.dev/discord)\n\n[![Modrinth](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/1eAoo2KR?color=00AF5C&label=downloads&logo=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)\n[![CurseForge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_667299_downloads.svg)](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/yacl)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/isxander)\n\nYet Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div

I understand that Smooth Boot can still be useful in version 1.20 and later, though personally I'm not interested in maintaining the mod right now. I also suggest a different name to be used, though you don't have to if you don't want to.

It boasts great compatibility with the wider mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is available for multiple mod loaders, but we recommend using [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) for the most simple and lightweight experience. If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed your mod loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks. ([before](https://streamable.com/lm5sp5), [after](https://streamable.com/nsdl0r))\n\n- We've written many optimizations for vertex building and transformation, which helps to speed up immediate-mode rendering. This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.  ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/6b0e58705156ba67a6d97a74b9f9ac05da69f502.webp))\n\n- Smooth lighting now works correctly on fluids and other special blocks ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/d84313e6f57dc9e7896961dbd2dfc2689d482758.webp)) We also fix a number of graphical issues with block shading ([comparison](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/images/56c4599efcb529a19aed0e118caad4178d7fd540.webp)) which helps to make everything look smoother.","published":"2021-01-03T00:53:34.185936Z","updated":"2024-09-15T18:02:42.687595Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":20768855,"followers":16659,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yaoBL9D9","YAGZ1cCS","1b0GhKHj","80jYkEVr","xuWxRZPd","3JJvf9Kn","6YGRDUVT","Fz37KqRh","5JyduDNN","74Y5Z8fo","Yp8wLY1P","F79MzDJD","rAfhHfow","mnEhtGuH","Nr39FOaS","ObtU68vj","oYfJQ6lR","idtcaIVT","b4hTi3mo","vgceLbdH","hiO9bwqc","OkwCNtFH","6SSPmLc9","4OZL6q9h","bbP1qBMr","lhZYeXLf","zPwAvKCF","InGKdfel","pmgeU5yX","rUXIwGKA","xNJ0Mpbx","umKbm1Rp","Wzzjm5lQ","mhZtY2lR","4GyXKCLd","hLV8Q8uu","IZskON6d","qhg37WBD","dNHeFokL","QHGZ9XSU","dEpHs0Hg","ygf8cVZg","OwLQelEI","RncWhTxD","rcNehRIZ","oZOSEhyy","vO5IVg3V","CcIWi5Av"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/AANobbMI/295862f4724dc3f78df3447ad6072b2dcd3ef0c9_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","author_id":"TEZXhE2U","featured":true,"name":"Sodium 0.5.8","version_number":"mc1.20.4-0.5.8","changelog":"- Fixed compatibility with Fabric API 0.95.3+ when using High Contrast or Programmer Art resource packs.\n- Improved support for keyboard accessibility features in parts of the video settings screen.

zoom mod with infinite customizability.*\n\nZoomify aims to provide the easiest, most configurable and most sexy looking zoom mod you will ever find.\n\n![Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/zoom-example.gif)\n\n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n</center></div>\n\n## How to use\n### Keybind\nInitially, Minecraft has a keybind that overrides Zoomify by default.\nGo to the controls menu and make sure the Zoomify keybind (default `C`)\nisn't conflicting (goes red).\n\n### Open settings menu\nYou can access the settings menu with two ways.\n\n- The client command `/zoomify`\n- [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) settings button\n\n## Features\n### Scroll Zoom\nYou can zoom in further using your scroll wheel.\n\n![Scroll Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/scroll-zoom-example.gif)\n\n### Spyglass Integration\nYou can configure Zoomify to only be able to zoom in when you are holding or carrying a spyglass.\nOr even just override the spyglass zoom with Zoomify!\n\nShow the spyglass overlay and play spyglass sound effects when using Zoomify.\n\n![Spyglass Integration Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/spyglass-integration-example.gif)\n\n### Transitions\n**14 different** transitions to choose from!\n\n- Instant\n- Linear\n- [Ease in Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInSine)\n- [Ease out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeOutSine)\n- [Ease in/out Sine](https://easings.net/#easeInOutSine)\n- [Ease in Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInQuad)\n- [Ease out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeOutQuad)\n- [Ease in/out Quad](https://easings.net/#easeInOutQuad)\n- [Ease in Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInCubic)\n- [Ease out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic)\n- [Ease in/out Cubic](https://easings.net/#easeInOutCubic)\n- [Ease in Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInExp)\n- [Ease out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeOutExp)\n- [Ease in/out Exponential](https://easings.net/#easeInOutExp)\n\nYou can even pick what transition you would like for zooming in and out individually!\n\n![Individual Transition Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/individual-transition.png)\n\n### Relative Sensitivity\nReduce your mouse sensitivity based on the amount of zoom,\nso you have fine control over your player.\n\n![Relative Sensitivity Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-sensitivity-example.gif)\n\n### Relative View Bobbing\nReduce the view bobbing effect based on the amount of zoom,\nso you can walk and zoom at the same time!\n\n![Relative View Bobbing Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/relative-view-bobbing-example.gif)\n\n### Cinematic Camera\nMake the mouse/camera smooth, like the zoom in [OptiFine](https://www.optifine.net).\n\n![Cinematic Cam Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/cinematic-cam-example.gif)\n\n### Affect Hand FOV\nTurn off this setting to prevent your hand from also being zoomed in!\n\n![Affect Hand FOV Turned Off Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/affect-hand-fov-disabled-example.gif)\n\n### Secondary Zoom\n\nCompletely separate zoom from normal Zoomify.\nAimed for content creators, features `Hide HUD While Zooming` option and longer zoom in times.\n\n![Secondary Zoom Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/secondary-zoom.gif)\n\n### Presets\n\nYou can reset to default, make Zoomify behave like OptiFine and others!\n\n### Smart Keybinding Detection\n\nOn first launch, if a keybinding is conflicting with Zoomify's zoom, a notification will appear notifying them of this.\n\n![Keybinding Conflict Detection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isXander/Zoomify/1.19/screenshots/keybind-conflict-detection.png)\n\n### Highly configurable\nAbsolutely **NO** hard-coded values. Everything about your zoom is configurable!\n\n### Control the zoom speed with seconds\nInstead of some stupid arbitrary value such as zoom speed, you can pick\nthe exact amount of seconds it will

lack of the <a style=\"font-size: 16px\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tails/\">Tails</a> mod for 1.16, Ears is a mod that adds ears, snouts, tails, horns, wings, and more to the player. Eventually, it also became a complete lightweight open source 1.9 skin backport for many old versions, which works even if you aren't using its special features.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ears has a more vanilla-faithful appearance than Tails, with a lot of 2D regions but a few 3D ones too. There are a wide variety of possible configurations and it can all be customized.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://unascribed.com/ears\"><img src=\"https://unascribed.com/ears-manipulator-banner.png?v=2\" alt=\"Configure your skin at The Manipulator (click here)\" width=\"512\" height=\"180\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Why use Ears instead of Tails?</b> Because Ears is easy to port to other versions, based on a multi-version abstraction allowing the mod to even run in web browsers. The Tails mod has wonderful 3D models and animations, but it's a burden to update it to any version due to its large rendering system and all the data syncing code, causing it to be tightly coupled with the version of the game and mod loader it was designed for. Ears stores all data as pixels in the player's skin.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>However, Ears requires you to draw your own additions</b>, and does not come with easy recolorable prefabs like Tails. Additionally, unlike CPM or Figura, Ears has a limited number of customization options. (Note that if you have a simple idea, I may add it. Open an issue on GitHub or hop in Discord.) <b>Ears offers a good middle-ground that will work in any version you wish to play</b>, and will receive updates to snapshots for those of you who live on the edge. It also does not and never will use external servers, just Mojang's skin server, so there's no concerns about a third-party server going down (be it temporarily or for good).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b>Why use Ears instead of other skin fixes?</b> Ears provides a lot of new features to customize your skin, and is a much more lightweight patch with no usage of third-party servers and is completely open source. Additionally, Ears backports translucent secondary layer support to 1.8 and 1.7.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Come discuss this mod and any of my others on <a href=\"https://discord.gg/8WBauq2eYK\">Discord</a> or <a href=\"https://matrix.to/#/#unascribed:sleeping.town\">Matrix</a>, or <a href=\"mailto:me@unascribed.com\">send me an email</a>.</p>","published":"2020-11-11T00:20:54.337883Z","updated":"2024-09-02T02:31:51.867384Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":315029,"followers":397,"categories":["decoration","social"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.2.5","1.4.7","1.5.2","1.6.4","1.7.10","1.8.9","1.9.4","1.10.2","1.11.2","1.12.2","1.13.2","1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","21w39a","21w40a","1.18-pre1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt","rift"],"versions":["lpXZo5cT","DNxeOyU0","8UFk7wTw","vqd5u0Ny","3sK5GNEL","L8WZew4h","UdpdOqsM","JkTHmv33","67mIJApL","YO0CxtvV","mnpF9fFT","JSrdBn2w","UTTnypyR","FnSgzXd0","ocBfsNxD","ImyGz7RA","SsojVERH","VEilm628","9YbGHfEj","5FJrNH3J","bLhYnp0N","KxVLjWg3","TaVgYwhU","k9MaA62j","5YK7HNNZ","FAJmOYgL","40LUvzls","YWUlc8NG","7pqhssyw","wkCD7q1B","bue40S7b","R9yScWb3","FVlXZqvd","p7ssOcRF","PUDRPcn5","Uob64eXA","iDpfYE15","wzUMomJt","vQ0ecy0S","U7n55kLU","6UpFQn6f","GW4TymkT","6kkaU73J","hpkHDJ02","IBZWz4tm","6eVHdmLT","X69Z7WNg","JEiBymvR","2UEJ2bZV","nDeloErl","tjC4UTlC","eT1jUCHE","OLNkOMhP","iSEGoIIV","8r6Scle5","JT6DGx1u","zvb9LH2m","m1RayfTh","N6axaImF","wyW8GHOl","6EaLm7o9","5JODEHyl","1OtCDZMR","rkEdZLz0","o8r0KF7H","e1KynUiG","ZYtJLvdi","2rjB1zfY","PkAlb37G","9sLhFUFw","XNWCCsZu","k52XL3dC","eGHaFJqz","xzyp9aQy","UGTo7ipt","tsLMkuq3","Tk6sKlgA","a9O6stzK","LtmojOrF","9j2uwa24","hj0ESCzj","tfhIqwrj","Kauqpx4E","7UsoRWEh","5yJoZxCt","NlQSU6h7","1bA50TFh","o64adsiA","hijroEbI","5iTp85Ww","N7U7djUO","vhKl0qVi","G4jwIfpw","HqAk3Ezs","cVfbaZ0z","coykKJQr","i4DPrUhV","REXxdi7m","Tn8DXAv1","JpXZeVrV","98TUHkys","iaefWKzr","f4JVWVHF","uEI4Rqnv","UQt29Bpz","f18UUct6","uSc7MTk2","1b2lQV5U","liCqUZY8","eUse71cB","zUciLb1g","o084ETVN","SeYRq7Pv","org8dcGX","Mb474e9o","CHd51bHd","rNhT9tHO","1xS8sgCi","soRZeRz5","Fy3hlVPV","JhJXSbJp","jkdSoyfQ","X748GRvR","ASSn1Ecv","zlMYwKBi","ZVqS2Euc","57lmbokW","gEudUghk","mbTY6PiH","MOD19itX","xkFTPUgR","CICXtsge","oUgoAXVV","w4JXZOck","eRcKSSZv","Dzcq39v9","Z3YvbAXk","s1OUR4VC","FZTR3XgE","MNnU0GCn","QekGXXrJ","HgrHJs7v","kngtmhTB","GD9ihSQX","7AcIEmmQ","wRX3RY6s","qZkbcILO","B0NFcUYx","TsVsSboo","A3Fr5dh4","IopeluGu","aLWfOeWZ","J2bf7xnn","Lr5BTYBp","90nzKLG6","XX0VYSjD","c97bUcFv","sTb8pEOY","qbgli4xy"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mfzaZK3Z/c92bcfa175f6d27c2616b6c427bb948c510acc88_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"90nzKLG6","project_id":"mfzaZK3Z","author_id":"wyHXuMwU","featured":false,"name":"[FABRIC 1.20.2] v1.4.6","version_number":"1.4.6+fabric-1.20.2","changelog":"* Ported to 1.202 by andi-makes — thanks!\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T20:27:45.012932Z","downloads":57529,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"a90ee7c9a7fac96228522263f9ff1e48900ef133","sha512":"3715e14219fa9b4448029349558fa9082d1f401389fb8facea21a775111c7d023e46d94b18f239e92be8d522cf1ac0b06d5e831e345712d3b08cd20c68b3bae8"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mfzaZK3Z/versions/90nzKLG6/ears-fabric-1.20.2-1.4.6.jar","filename":"ears-fabric-1.20.2-1.4.6.jar","primary":true,"size":170354,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"4dPJJaoX","user":{"id":"3g0nMgcw","username":"LemmaEOF","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6722691?v=4","bio":"Chubby robot VTuber who occasionally gets dragged back in to make Minecraft mods","created":"2020-10-27T10:36:47.440938Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Mascot","ordering":0},{"team_id":"4dPJJaoX","user":{"id":"wyHXuMwU","username":"unascribed","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6185037?v=4","bio":"Running servers since 2009 and no one knows why.

Most Forge 1.16-1.19.2 modpacks will launch **roughly twice as fast** with ModernFix installed.\nIf some non-default options are enabled, it can even allow large modpacks like All The Mods 8 to run with **3GB or less of allocated memory**.\n\nModernFix is free, open-source software. All of the code is available on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix).\n\n## ⚙️ Technical summary\n\nWhat exactly does ModernFix do for your game? There are a lot of tweaks being made - too many to summarize here. However, here is a\nbrief summary of the general types of improvements being made:\n\n* Backports of bugfixes from newer versions of Minecraft and/or Forge, e.g. fixing\n[worlds breaking when you remove a dimension mod in 1.18](https://github.com/MinecraftForge/MinecraftForge/issues/8800).\n* Patches to mods that are no longer supported on a given Minecraft version, to improve the gameplay experience instead of requiring\nplayers to update.\n* Many optimizations & improvements to the game's launch process to significantly improve speed and reduce random concurrency crashes.\n* Additional debug tools to help modders and players determine the cause of some rare game crashes/freezes, instead of relying on a painful\nmod bisection process.\n* It's not enabled by default due to compatibility issues, but ModernFix includes functionality to [completely redesign the game's model loading system](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Dynamic-Resources-FAQ), replacing it with a new,\ndynamic version that loads models on the fly. Model loading is one of the major performance regressions to modded Minecraft that\nhas been present since 1.8, and this new system alleviates nearly all of the downsides, bringing memory usage and loading times\nmore in line with how they were in 1.7.10.\n* Need to play the game with very little RAM allocated (e.g. 512MB or less)? [Now you can do that.](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Ultra%E2%80%90Low-Memory-Footprint)\n\nIf you are technically savvy and looking for more details on each patch, I recommend reading the [Summary of Patches](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix/wiki/Summary-of-Patches) wiki page.\n\n## 🐛 Where to go when something doesn't work\n\nPlease either report an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/embeddedt/ModernFix), or join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/rN9Y7caguP) and ask in the `#modernfix-discussion` channel.\nBe sure to mention the Minecraft version, modloader, and ModernFix version you are using, as well as what other mods you have installed.\n\n## 🎁 How can I support this project?\n\nThere are two main ways you can help support the development of ModernFix:\n\n* Spread the word! Test ModernFix in modpacks and encourage them to include it.\n* If you feel generous, I do accept donations via [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/embeddedt). Donating is not required (as ModernFix is free),\nbut every little bit helps. I work on ModernFix in my spare time, so any compensation I receive helps to sustain development.\n\n## ❓ What other mods should I use?\n\nThere are many performance mods available for Minecraft and I can't list them all here, but here are some essential mods, in my opinion:\n\n- On any version before 1.19.4 you should always have LazyDFU installed, as it eliminates the incredible lag caused by the DFU system.\n- On any version before 1.20 you should generally use Starlight unless it has a compatibility issue with your mods (which is quite rare).\nIt offers vastly improved lighting performance and can also fix FPS stutters when moving between chunks.\n- Always have FerriteCore installed, as Mojang's implementation of blockstates/models is laughably inefficient, and quickly\nconsumes RAM as soon as more content is added beyond what vanilla offers.\n- Install a mod like Shutup Experimental settings (before 1.19) or Yeetus Experimentus (1.19+). These mods will suppress the\npop-up screen about experimental game features, which otherwise causes the game to reload its resources twice.\n\nOn a related note: I do **not** recommend use of OptiFine in any modded scenario. It is closed-source, patches the game in a way that easily breaks\nForge and other mods, and significantly slows down game launching, often on the order of minutes.

Features\n\n[![Enviroment](https://img.shields.io/badge/Enviroment-Client-purple)](https://modrinth.com/mods?e=client)\n[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/950942125225283634?color=blue&logo=discord&label=Discord)](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz)\n\n[![Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/traben)\n\n## 🤔 What does this mod do?\n\nETF is a Fabric (Quilt compatible) & Forge mod that adds many new _Entity Texture Features_, including entity and player skin features!\nThis way, ETF achieves more OptiFine parity on the Fabric mod loader. If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your

Whether you're using Linux, macOS, or Windows, you can keep the game open while interacting with other applications on a different monitor *(or even directly on top of the game window)*, without constantly causing Minecraft to minimize.\n\n----\n\n## Usage\n\nThe mod doesn't introduce any additional configuration screens. Instead, it utilizes the existing `Video Settings` tab, where you would expect to find an option of this kind, and extends the pre-existing `Fullscreen` setting, adding a third option to it: `Borderless`.\n\nSo, depending on whether you have Sodium installed, you may find the option in question here:\n\n| ![Video Setting](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ETlrkaYF/images/094405267bc8079392b4c2075a0bb479ec402266.png) | ![Video Setting (Sodium)](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ETlrkaYF/images/a5454794b3904db69c1ef5df7fd1edf95ec09027.png) |\n| - | - |\n\nSimply choose the new `Borderless` option, click `Apply` and/or `Done`, and you are good to go.\n\nAdditionally, the mod introduces a `--borderless` startup flag for those interested, which works the same way as the existing `--fullscreen` one, but forces the game to start as a borderless fullscreen window instead.\n\n----\n\n## Notes\n\n### KDE Plasma\n\nIn case you want to open a Picture-in-Picture video on top of your Minecraft gameplay, while you painstakingly mine obsidian pillars in The End for a new mega-project, you may notice that it doesn't quite work as you would expect on KDE Plasma - Minecraft simply renders on top of the supposedly always-on-top window.\n\nUnfortunately, there's nothing I can do on my side, since a borderless fullscreen window is still a fullscreen window, and this behavior is explicitly defined by [the FreeDesktop spec](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-1.3.html#STACKINGORDER), which was written long before it became common for people to display PiP windows on top of their fullscreen games. GNOME users don't suffer from this problem, because GNOME simply broke the specification without even attempting to start a discussion around it and change it for everyone's benefit, which is a very GNOME thing to do.\n\nHowever, you can define a simple window rule to change the PiP's layer to something that renders on top of fullscreen windows, such as `OSD` or `Overlay`. With this in place, you will be able to put PiP windows on top of Minecraft, other games, and any other fullscreen apps for that matter.

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19. Iris may not always be compatible with the latest release or build of Indium - please ask the Iris support channels if you have issues.","published":"2021-07-19T17:56:39.449041Z","updated":"2024-08-15T17:24:30.310929Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":10535881,"followers":7646,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Zk2jPxcx","uTvfCUBM","mfNlBb6U","1ApUEVoW","CVUGSVU0","Rxzic9a0","D0fLM4o1","ZxoJeTLg","TpvP0qDc","lK43uDfu","Rli2nU8i","H4bOnadw","H45YVREb","mJ7WqoOY","WG5jreCt","yTfou6df","BoAba4K3","KqmHL1pI","85NvAOjQ","tMamyl08","U94NcDpV","qqiFL8NF","M7szjcI4","WTH3T2cR","oYQsfz9e","9dgIzesu","yTh7W27h","OPwFzZCT","HIQfyNd3","hfBawPLH","6UQwWURe","Lue6O9z9","tD2IqHXC","nTorcOMQ","Aouse6P7","VlLxDisa","XPsoVC5n","w4F7PG0f","gofbpynL","K4hsdO9H","Z8VpxxGh"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/13f4ab01fac350702ba20871c9f964064073a5e2_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"Aouse6P7","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":false,"name":"Indium 1.0.30 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Also allow 1.20.1 (fixes #277) (comp500)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.30+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-02-06T00:32:27.223998Z","downloads":2728860,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"3b9c9beef42f72bc75094595c92038c38e36fcde75890c73ced01aed4fb2a8a85cddb8edd2aa91ea6ed2dd41f8afedaa3dbca8f70c716197a7f2ee5b26060562","sha1":"b24233f29c0ce4802c61ea8998e01e6e4580ae60"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/Aouse6P7/indium-1.0.30%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":104805,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"X5s94xjx","user":{"id":"M6f6rkfI","username":"comp500","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/1138417?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-03T01:13:52.122363Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"VlLxDisa","project_id":"Orvt0mRa","author_id":"M6f6rkfI","featured":true,"name":"Indium 1.0.31 for Minecraft 1.20.x/Sodium 0.5.8/Fabric API 0.89+","version_number":"1.0.31+mc1.20.4","changelog":"- Bump version, remove 1.20.2 as supported Minecraft version (comp500)\n- Merge pull request #295 from PepperCode1/pr/1.20.x/main/fix-model-offset (comp500)\n- Fix non-terrain model offset (PepperCode1)\n\nSee the full changes on Github: https://github.com/comp500/Indium/commits/1.0.31+mc1.20.4","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-10T18:21:08.640568Z","downloads":453180,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"27b4a73ca990742e27eee4348553c86c96c19fddcd0763892029f67ddbde42dc03c0ac21230403ae6b4ce4da315d0d49f582d3daab413b9ea84fd6d172ee7c4f","sha1":"fe6d0513ac332d890f1bd9bb9354a8e240b8f0e5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Orvt0mRa/versions/VlLxDisa/indium-1.0.31%2Bmc1.20.4.jar","filename":"indium-1.0.31+mc1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":105350,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"4GyXKCLd","project_id":"AANobbMI","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"indium-1.0.30+mc1.20.4.jar"},"mods\\yosbr-0.1.2.jar":{"sha512":"254f2225f6446523aa8c8274e83b31e27f3b2afc8fe4f490fb1b169dd518e10c7993acda5db0ab597474ddf9d69506b5e794242fada1e2f89ed7bf9d412a8f78","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"WwbubTsV","slug":"yosbr","project_type":"mod","team":"GBU3scgV","title":"Your Options Shall Be Respected (YOSBR)","description":"Your options shall be respected.","body":"Your options shall be respected, brought to you by the \"Association for Options Rights\" gang.\n\nThis mod has one simple function, to provide default options if the corresponding option file doesn't exist.\n\n### Example 1 (options.txt)\n\nCreate /config/yosbr/options.txt\nPut default content in it\nLaunch game!

you return to the Title Screen early while your world is still saving in the background!","body":"## FastQuit\n\n### About this mod\n\nThis mod lets you return to the title screen early while your world is still saving in the background.\n\nDon't worry, the mod will wait for the world to finish saving when necessary, no data will be lost!\n\nThe world will show up on the world list, and you can even edit, delete or recreate it while it is still saving.\nThis is done by reusing the info from the still saving world.\n\nIn its current state this should be safe to do as measures for thread safety have been taken.\nIf you do somehow still encounter an issue, the worst thing to happen will be the action failing and Minecraft showing you a toast informing you of it.\n\n**If that happens, please [open an issue](#problems) with your .minecraft/logs/latest.log file attached!**\n\n### Join the Discord!\n\nIf you are interested in my mods or have any questions, you can join my [Discord](https://discord.gg/B6ZV8SF672)!\n\n### Configure\n\nTo configure the mod, open the config screen from [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) or go to .minecraft/config/fastquit-config.txt.\n\nThere is currently three options to configure:\n\n**Show Toasts**:\n\nDetermines whether a toast gets shown when a world finishes saving.\n\n**Background Thread Priority**:\n\nSets the thread priority of the server when saving worlds in the background.\nThis is done to improve client performance while saving, but will make the saving take longer over all.\nValue has to be between 0 and 10, setting it to 0 will disable changing thread priority.\n\n**Render \"Saving world\" Screen**:\n\nWhen playing on high render distance, quitting the world can still take a bit because the client-side chunk storage has to be cleared.\nBy enabling this setting the \"Saving world\" screen will be rendered.\n\n**Show Saving Time**\n\nDetermines whether the time it took to save the world gets displayed on toasts and the world list.\nValue has to be between 0 and 2, with 0 never showing the time, 1 only on the toast and 2 also on the world list. In ModMenu these are accordingly labelled.\n\n### How does this mod work?\n\n**At it's core, this mod is quite simple:**\n\nNormally, when quitting a singleplayer world, the client will wait until the server thread has finished saving the world before going to the Title Screen.\nThis mod skips this waiting period and lets the server continue saving in the background.\n\n**PLEASE NOTE** this does not always make quitting a world instant, as the client can still take a bit of time to unload rendered chunks etc. However, even in that case you will see a speedup as clientside unloading and serverside saving now perform simultaneously instead of one after the other.\n\n**Of course in practice this is not quite that easy:**\n\nWhen working with multiple threads like this, many problems arise.\nFor example, when going to the world list, Minecraft will try to read its level data but fails because the background saving still locks the world file.\n\nInstead, we now access the information through the still saving server.\nSimilarly, when trying to edit, delete or recreate the world, we have to use the existing session.\n\nTo keep these processes thread safe, a lot of synchronization has to be done to ensure the saving server and the client don't get in each other's way.\n\nFor some things, like rejoining the still saving world or making a backup, we just wait for the server to finish saving completely.\nWe also wait for the worlds to finish saving when quitting the game to ensure no data is lost.\n\n### Thanks to...\n\n#### Translators:\n- Felix14-v2 (Russian)\n- Cccc-owo (Simplified Chinese)\n- JustAlittleWolf (German)\n- YakisikliBaran (Turkish)\n- Skidamek (Polish)\n- Oondanomala (Italian)\n- Madis0 (Estonian)\n- notlin4 (Traditional Chinese)\n- BurrConnie (Ukrainian)\n- GodGun968 (Simplified Chinese)\n- ImVietnam (Vietnamese)\n- ishi-sama (French)\n- KAGUYA-1137 (Japanese)\n####\n\n### Compatibility\n\nWith the help of [MixinExtras](https://github.com/LlamaLad7/MixinExtras) and a custom Mixin Config Plugin, the mixins have been designed to be very non-intrusive while also being very effective.\n\nBecause of that there is currently no known incompatibilities.\n\nIf you do suspect an incompatibility with another mod, please [open an issue](#problems)!\n\n### Problems?\n\nIf you are experiencing any problems, please open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/KingContaria/FastQuit/issues)!\n\nMake sure to attach important info like other mods you were using, log- or crash-files and if possible steps to reproduce.\n\nBefore uploading any files make sure to get rid of personal data!

It includes two built-in resource packs. The Default Connected Textures pack provides connected textures for glass, sandstone, and bookshelves, similar to the built-in connected textures provided by OptiFine. The Glass Pane Culling Fix pack culls faces between vertically stacked glass panes to make them look seamless with connected textures.\n\nFormally, Continuity implements the Continuity connected textures specification, Continuity emissive textures specification, and Continuity custom block layers specification. All of these are extensions of the corresponding OptiFine specification and were created to provide more features to resource pack authors. The documentation for the Continuity specifications can be found at the [Continuity wiki](https://github.com/PepperCode1/Continuity/wiki).\n\nAn official Forge version of Continuity is not planned at this time due to major technical differences between the Fabric and Forge APIs. An official Forge version of Continuity may be considered if these differences are minimized, possibly via the use of libraries.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge

Now rewritten from scratch in Kotlin for cleaner code, better performance, more features, and extensibility.\nOther mods' developers can add their custom containers and customization options. See documentation link above.\n\n[Supports most OptiFine GUI resource packs](#supported-resource-packs). If a resource pack does not work or works differently than using OptiFine, please open an issue (select the **Report a bug** template).\n\nCheck out my new OptiGUI resource pack for Minecraft 1.19+: [Chest Boat GUI](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/chest-boat-gui)\n\n[![BisectHosting banner](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/a661d818-b1af-427c-9754-12e8b243fd60.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/opekope2)\n\n## How to use it\n\n1. Download and install [Fabric loader](https://fabricmc.net/use) or [Quilt loader](https://quiltmc.org/en/install)\n2. Download this mod from your [favorite service](#optigui)\n3. Download the required dependencies as well\n4. Put this mod in your mods folder\n\n## Resource pack docs\n\nOptiGUI supports OptiFine custom GUI resource packs, and also supports OptiGUI resource packs. OptiGUI resource packs are more flexible than OptiFine resource packs.\nSee documentation link above to get started.\n\n## Supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [Colourful Containers](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-gui/)\n* [Colourful Containers Add-On](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/updated-colourful-containers-light-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Colourful Containers Dark Mode](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/colourful-containers-dark-mode-gui-optifine-required/)\n* [Animated RGB GUI](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/optifine-animated-rgb-gui) ¹\n* [NEON20 ANIMATED](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/neon20-animated-optifine/)\n* [Rybo's Enhanced GUI](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/rybo-s-enhanced-gui/)\n* [Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/animated-fox-guis-1-16-x/) ¹\n* [\\[DARK\\] Animated Fox Guis](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fox-4931933/) ¹\n* [Recolourful Containers GUI + HUD](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/recolourful-containers-gui-hud)\n\n¹ see FAQ for animation support\n\nThis list is not exhaustive. If you know a resource pack which works, and you'd like to see it here, or a resource pack, which does not work, but works with OptiFine, please open an issue.\n\n## Partially supported resource packs\n\nExcluding vanilla resource packs (which don't container OptiFine or OptiGUI-specific files)\n\n* [New Default+](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/newdefaultplus) ¹\n\n¹ Barrel does not work, neither does it work with OptiFine. The resource pack does not specify it according to the format.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Use in a modpack?\n\nYes.\n\n### OptiFine GUI animations?\n\nOnly with [Animatica](https://modrinth.com/mod/animatica).\n\n### OptiFine colors (colors.properties)?\n\nNo, use [Colormatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/colormatic).\n\n### Performance impact?\n\nOptiGUI's performance impact is negligible (tho it varies a bit depending on which resource packs are used).\n\n### Configuration GUI/file?\n\nNothing to configure.\n\n### Sodium?\n\nYes.\n\n### OptiFine?\n\nActually, OptiGUI and OptiFine (with OptiFabric) **can** be loaded simultaneously.\nI have observed that OptiGUI mixins will be placed before OptiFine ones, so you can turn off custom GUIs in OptiFine to save performance.\n\nHowever, I can't assist you with this.\n\n### Supported loaders?\n\nFabric & Quilt. Anything else is not supported, those may or may not work.\n","published":"2022-05-02T09:52:47.910376Z","updated":"2024-06-15T17:35:23.255930Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3017196,"followers":807,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["LICx0kWh","W7KZowlh","GlXDrxTY","jvJfecx9","2zE7dj3R","bds6PhCr","LjxrGjwN","KWUgM1Pm","EmeZ0Gqt","SBi7COdt","enCs35o3","QNaBS24G","o5KsFiVJ","WwSxteqI","w1ctchwV","DvWsedjb","IDfdFriT","KaUaJJ1i","jdW6CBhM","RMa6KMf9","HpDkLZjj","bqQWHwWx","ehlFpVEb","3uGk4ChO","eM7FKWWG","L99Bxt2Y","2oUHeIhM","v4BLjO6F","vJb4cpaY","TM9YqUwX","EOU9oC3S","LVdJJtmU","XflepaVP","P6myMR8K","xQrH4kWR","YU9Yi2mO","41AoOR3G","3CSEKfcd","x0k8u61W","noPVqZnY","rBFq3aQs","xpfegZsE","cGrREnKA","pUVuXS69","2FbON5jl","dPuD2Nuk"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/5e7e96524f7a7bcd8fb8936da34f8a26fb5c6a41_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"xpfegZsE","project_id":"JuksLGBQ","author_id":"PpKojnYx","featured":false,"name":"OptiGUI 2.1.7","version_number":"2.1.7","changelog":"# OptiGUI 2.1.7\n\n## What's new since 2.1.6\n\n* Add support for Minecraft 1.20.3 and 1.20.4\n\n## About this release\n\n* This release is based on the legacy 2.1.5 codebase, and only has minimal changes\n* The code is available on the [`legacy/2.1.7`](https://github.com/opekope2/OptiGUI/tree/legacy/2.1.7) branch, and will not be merged into the `main` branch\n  * The tag is also on the `legacy/2.1.7` branch instead of the usual `main`\n\n## Recommendations\n\n* Recommended for everyday users\n* Recommended for modpacks\n* Documentation is available on [GitHub Pages](https://opekope2.github.io/OptiGUI)\n* Quilt users, please wait for the next Quilt Loader update\n\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-12-15T22:49:22.965754Z","downloads":770718,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"47040b4c65b6381ca61bc3af61fee4df279b5eec","sha512":"d4b32aafbb4a1939476636906bd9fefaae23f7bd83ca39a94071a58fad3603d2efb3656c811291f68017f053b0f8aaf471d470fe4b9d5de21f256dfbbede76fa"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/versions/xpfegZsE/optigui-2.1.7.jar","filename":"optigui-2.1.7.jar","primary":true,"size":780572,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha512":"ff79f059700d51b3cbd2c6e138620753bc6c32eb6a0267671c3d0d2fadfaefeac3f71257696237382a2b461902b12250682d0c1810035dbab17329695b7e0e63","sha1":"a30bd00ac3b8e02c8aac13368a8239c6b55c9af2"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JuksLGBQ/versions/xpfegZsE/optigui-2.1.7-sources.jar","filename":"optigui-2.1.7-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":74697,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"PRN43VSY","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"Ha28R6CL","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"LKrNHI7T","user":{"id":"PpKojnYx","username":"opekope2","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20487556?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-05-02T09:42:18.771673Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"pUVuXS69","project_id":"JuksLGBQ","author_id":"PpKojnYx","featured":false,"name":"OptiGUI 2.3.0-beta.2","version_number":"2.3.0-beta.2","changelog":"# OptiGUI 2.3.0-beta.2\n\n## Where's 2.3.0-beta.1?\n\nIt was removed due to incompatibilities with Minecraft 1.20.5.\n\n## What's new since 2.3.0-alpha.2\n\n* Support for Minecraft 1.20.5\n  * Block entity NBT is not available in the inspector on this version\n\n## What changed since 2.3.0-alpha.2\n\n* Fix villager.type selector\n\n## About this release\n\n* This version will refuse to load on Minecraft 1.20.5.

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nYou can also configure these settings for when you're idling (with a custom timeout) or while your laptop / handheld is on battery.  \nOptionally you may also display the current battery status on the in-game HUD and receive toast notifications about battery activity.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops\nrendering the world while it's being obscured by resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nEnabling the battery integration requires downloading an additional library at runtime.  \nThe mod contains the hashes for these files ahead of time and will verify them before usage.\n\nYou may disable this behavior in the mod's settings, or [install the library yourself](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/blob/main/docs/manual-natives-install.md) if you wish.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-09-08T18:29:08.189469Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":7573170,"followers":4375,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1-pre2","1.17.1-pre3","1.17.1-rc1","1.17.1-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-pre1","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1-pre3","1.19.1-pre4","1.19.1-pre5","1.19.1-pre6","1.19.1-rc2","1.19.1-rc3","1.19.1","1.19.2-rc1","1.19.2-rc2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w41a","23w42a","23w43a","23w43b","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21","1.21.1-rc1","1.21.1","24w33a","24w34a","24w35a","24w36a","24w37a","24w38a"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P","TsACcqoR","zABNE034","RS3zegai","RCY49qLv","GzuwoJDO","U0tp6QIQ","mUoNvE18","ANanuCGR","XNQmNGUo","H3jM6EoR","aM6FmhY7","TLSV8m3h","LF4zDKeR","MbErXFSW","F7x3PReU","z9Xj6TuQ","NU3HRHXj","PyDPmXHD","wzp3skkc","aPRTCnlc","5fk6vDb1","U1cZ1TL7","8Hd00M1M","OjAim4Jo","ESoagl4C","pHWNKS7t","BNf9EmNl","JRl3y7rm","tEiWfX1N","uHnzIEQj","dliDieeY","wBsh7vqV","YF37wYKK","FonmH7YD","nTdQW3oL","KEs1F4M2","pMITUDDN","RYTZvQBc","TSSDSiZP","kbiP4CMi","qRc80r3o","jdsdQwkB","6FJB6Cff","DdDJ86cX","Xd3OWazo","eRegd530","jVjy8fjK","aLCEN12X","lSXJY9xl","FFFxotk0","JiiW7oPc","LlYJQJc0","imrXtkp1","GCbqf3Es","FxizL9t5","1nYqpxqz","ks5hKqn1","t4XJUfdJ","TfKF27MT","9gdFVbPJ","LP8Tu8Ll","G9r3hXu4","b1zBQl0B","5e8bQR5b","lb0ERSTU","zVtEuiz1","mXDQxXwm","dXkCBME4","oFct4NKJ","WJuoKsuM","AhFXokhh","QzrbOBED","sOzoK2fb","d6n6Sb6I","5W8VDiH4","a2IbMyKC","sEzImHwf","h06Upukv","Pcmh7OK0","tHSt3yUI","qfUfpOBS","iSAuMKvE","xQUOTslP","XAe7mdMi","4T8GrChY","P279QZmx","9RQmLH9X","9Z8wC7Bs","sA9AN6iB","4UrwSLvV","yHvN9viy","hqTdt4bl","5P9Foxif","SsKRtIyS","R1Otz1WG","K3llA9y2","UZugeJO9","3MCj6qoZ","TwDvMMdE","u3GllwCC","PKPrwsmh","DyKTQ9qw","iaFlHFEr","Ao8PBvh6","FbNkaZBJ","k43Gdwy2","zYXfsqA5","5TxkcmeE","X5VTy6uf","Lvh11xC8","xXDq3Ptc","GtitXgiZ","MO25GW56","7sQlugss","D4YOJGoV","wKxQLFIt","qKKrOWrO","flIO89c2","RZDYy0mt","iPggdyUp","6h1tu8Mr","JLiyLuHa","GGeYe3vC","vSb6nnhw","SyA5ADUs","qqblKu56","f8GynEJ1","xcw5AkDc","ptYqqAo0"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/5056368d0d87c1a9f3efead0cb48ab39a4ea87bf_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"shfvdKKK","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.4.2","version_number":"3.4.2","changelog":"-

Block Entities","description":"Reduce block entity FPS lag with almost no compromises, and improve their visuals","body":"## Enhanced Block Entities\n\nEBE is a **100% client side** Minecraft mod for the **[Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/)** mod loader which aims to increase the performance of block entity rendering, as well as offer customizability via resource packs. <br/><br/>\n**How does it work?** EBE Makes some block entities use baked block models rather than laggy entity models. <br/><br/>\n**Is it just an optimization mod?** EBE isn't *just* an optimization mod, some side effects of its optimizations are many visual improvements. <br/>\nThese may include:\n- Smooth lighting on block entities\n- Being able to remodel block entities with block models\n- Toggling features like christmas chests\n- Being able to see block entities from as far away as possible\n<br/><br/>\n\n**What about animations?** The best part about EBE is that you still get to keep animations, while gaining the performance boost of baked models! Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n\n### EBE v0.10.2+ will work with [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) 0.6+ with no additional mods needed.\n**ONLY** For earlier EBE versions, use [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) along with Sodium 0.5.11 or below.<br/>\n**Requires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)**\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests have glitched animations!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using Sodium, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use Sodium with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You may be using a resource pack that conflicts with EBE. Open the Block Entity Settings menu (through EBE's Mod Menu entry or through vanilla Video Settings) and enable \"Force Resource Pack Compatibility\". <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n- Decorated Pots\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2024-09-19T22:18:51.070183Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4882147,"followers":3908,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6","1.21","1.21.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq","xeHyTMq8","Ihazqamt","xUOoKrs2","BKpMtYZB","8OuTJDGd","HBZAPs3u"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/7313d540ef9514d8680acd5b3feb6a5a079f20fe_96.webp"},"version":{"id":"eIFo7wvq","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":false,"name":"EBE v0.9.1 for 1.20.2","version_number":"0.9.1+1.20.2","changelog":"- Update to 1.20.2\n- Fixed chest/shulker box/bell animations flashing when placed on chunk borders (without Sodium installed)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-11-26T00:58:48.609016Z","downloads":759542,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"c6f2c68254624d3add2645766b5ceb467bba9931d5ef357d0d580352b12ed102ce33818be4ca318e97edb34eeb771672b81725f9aee75114e4eb508c8a05396d","sha1":"7d40ccbc5355602325ad3e633592441a63a3999a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/eIFo7wvq/enhancedblockentities-0.9.1%2B1.20.2.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9.1+1.20.2.jar","primary":true,"size":492605,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"xUOoKrs2","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.10.1 for 1.20.4","version_number":"0.10.1+1.20.4","changelog":"- No longer crashes when invalid items are used as pot sherds\n- Block atlas changes during resource reloads should no longer corrupt animated block entity models","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-06-13T19:41:16.023810Z","downloads":129492,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"f2b182c46486ecce3a2f84893efb1c1b9382e859","sha512":"36885e53d47764060a9fab5953f725c3fb82fa93285a6e5e01f44ffd4df105a9e2d9747ba15fe25462ce0b6909e99db447ef3ea5c0c1ea3a7007eec452adbb8f"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/xUOoKrs2/enhancedblockentities-0.10.1%2B1.20.4.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.10.1+1.20.4.jar","primary":true,"size":330603,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"USLVyT7V","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"embedded"}],"game_versions":["1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"incompatible":false},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9.1+1.20.2.jar"},"mods\\modmenu-9.2.0-beta.2.jar":{"sha512":"e8a73596f6ed279a9c4da7d2c0e9c5f08a8deb563626dcc47380be93f15cfcff9c12e2973317f6306cd53842b1eb0cdd62f4dbd75f580edb00476b3e4435331e","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"mOgUt4GM","slug":"modmenu","project_type":"mod","team":"VMz4FpgB","title":"Mod Menu","description":"Adds a mod menu to view the list of mods you have installed.","body":"# Mod Menu\n![Screenshot of the Mods screen, showing a list of a few mods on the left side below a search bar and filters button, where Mod Menu is selected. On the right side of the screen, it shows more details about the mod, such as authors, a description, links, credits, and a button to configure the mod.](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/images/155dd2b006883b168b1279ec0ff21e753946518b.png)\n\nMod Menu lets you view the mods you have installed and, if supported by the mod, enables quick and easy access to the mod's config screens.\n\nMod Menu also supports some more advanced features, such as translatable mod names and descriptions, support for [QuickText formatting](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/) in mod descriptions thanks to [Patbox](https://ko-fi.com/patbox)'s [Text Placeholder API](https://modrinth.com/mod/placeholder-api), filters library mods out from regular mods, a mod update checker for mods hosted on Modrinth or that provide their own update sources, and deep configuration for all the features we provide.\n\n### Supported Platforms\nMod Menu is currently available for Fabric or Quilt on Minecraft: Java Edition 1.14 or newer.\n\n## Developers\nMod Menu includes a number of APIs for developers to improve how their mod appears in Mod Menu. These come in the form of language keys, JSON metadata, and even a Java API.\n\n### Translation API\nYou can translate your mod's name, summary, and description all without touching any Java code. Simply add translation keys in the supported format to any language you'd like.\n\n<details>\n<summary>Translation API Documentation</summary>\n\nHere's an example of Mod Menu's translations into Pirate Speak. To create your own, simply replace `modmenu` at the end (***NOT*** the one in the beginning) of the translation key with your own mod ID, for example `modmenu.descriptionTranslation.traverse`.\n\n`en_pt.json`\n```json\n\"modmenu.nameTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods!\",\n\"modmenu.descriptionTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\",\n\"modmenu.summaryTranslation.modmenu\": \"Menu o' mods ye installed matey!\"\n```\n\n> The summary translation is redundant here and does not need to be included because it's the same as the description, but it was included to show that you may translate the summary (a short, one-sentence description of the mod) separately from the description, even in English!\n\n</details>\n\n\n\n### Fabric Metadata API\nThere's a number of things you can add just with metadata in your `fabric.mod.json`.\n\nAll of these are added to a custom block in your `fabric.mod.json` for Mod Menu's metadata. Here's an example usage of many of the features this API provides:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n      \"links\": {\n        \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n      },\n      \"badges\": [ \"library\", \"deprecated\" ],\n      \"parent\": {\n        \"id\": \"example-api\",\n        \"name\": \"Example API\",\n        \"description\": \"Modular example library\",\n        \"icon\": \"assets/example-api-module-v1/parent_icon.png\",\n        \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n      },\n      \"update_checker\": true\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<details>\n<summary>Fabric Metadata API Documentation</summary>\n\n#### Badges (`\"badges\": [ ]`)\nWhile the `Client` badge is added automatically to mods set as client-side only (set `\"environment\": \"client\"` in `fabric.mod.json` to do this.), other badges such as the `Library` and `Deprecated` badges require definition here.\n\nSupported values:\n- `library` - should be assigned to mods that are purely dependencies for other mods that should not be shown to the user by default unless they toggle them on.\n- `deprecated` - should be assigned to mods that exist purely for legacy reasons, such as an old API module or such.\n\nAny others will be ignored, and Mod Menu does not support adding your own badges. You may open an issue [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/issues) if you have a compelling use case for a new badge.\n\n#### Links (`\"links\": { }`)\nThe `links` object allows mod authors to add custom hyperlinks to the end of their description. If you specify a `sources` contact in the official `fabric.mod.json` metadata, it will also be included in the links section.\n\nAny key in the `links` object will be included in the links section, with the key being used as a translation key. For example, this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"links\": {\n          \"modmenu.discord\": \"https://discord.gg/jEGF5fb\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\nwill show as a link with the text \"Discord\", since \"Discord\" is the English translation of \"modmenu.discord\" provided by Mod Menu.\n\nMod Menu provides several default translations that can be used for links. A full list can be seen in Mod Menu's language file [here](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu/blob/-/src/main/resources/assets/modmenu/lang/en_us.json). All default link translation keys take the form `modmenu.<type>`.\n\nYou can also provide your own translations if you would like to add custom links. Make sure to use ***your own namespace*** (as opposed to `modmenu`) for any custom keys.\n\n#### Parents (`\"parent\": \"mod_id\" or { }`)\n<img align=\"right\" width=\"400\" src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ZutCprf.png\">\n\nParents are used to display a mod as a child of another one. This is meant to be used for mods divided into different modules. The following element in a `fabric.mod.json` will define the mod as a child of the mod 'flamingo': \n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": \"flamingo\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nHowever, if you want to group mods under a parent, but the parent isn't an actual mod, you can do that too. In the example below, a mod is defining metadata for a parent. Make sure that this metadata is included in all of the children that use the fake/dummy parent. This can also be used as a fallback for an optional parent, it will be replace by the mod's real metadata if present.\n\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"parent\": {\n            \"id\": \"this-mod-isnt-real\",\n            \"name\": \"Fake Mod\",\n            \"description\": \"Do cool stuff with this fake mod\",\n            \"icon\": \"assets/real-mod/fake-mod-icon.png\",\n            \"badges\": [ \"library\" ]\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\nDummy parent mods only support the following metadata:\n- `id` (String)\n- `name` (String)\n- `description` (String)\n- `icon` (String)\n- `badges` (Array of Strings)\n\n\n#### Disable update checker (`\"update_checker\": false`)\nBy default, Mod Menu's update checker will use the hash of your mod's jar to lookup the latest version on Modrinth. If it finds a matching project, it will check for the latest version that supports your mod loader and Minecraft version, and if it has a different hash from your existing file, it will prompt the user that there is an update available.\n\nYou can disable the update checker by setting `update_checker` to false in your Mod Menu metadata like so:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"custom\": {\n    \"modmenu\": {\n        \"update_checker\": false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n### Quilt Metadata API\nSince Mod Menu supports Quilt as well, the same APIs in the Fabric Metadata API section are also available for Quilt mods, but the format for custom metadata is slightly different. \n\nInstead of a `\"modmenu\"` block inside of a `\"custom\"` block, you put the `\"modmenu\"` block as an element in the root object. So it should look like:\n\n`quilt.mod.json`\n```json5\n{\n  ...\n  \"modmenu\": {\n    // Here's where your links, badges, etc. stuff goes\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Java API\nTo use the Java API, you'll need to add Mod Menu as a compile-time dependency in your gradle project. This won't make your mod require Mod Menu, but it'll be present in your environment for you to test with.\n\n`build.gradle`\n```gradle\n// Add the Terraformers maven repo to your repositories block\nrepositories {\n  maven {\n    name = \"Terraformers\"\n    url = \"https://maven.terraformersmc.com/\"\n  }\n}\n\n// Add Mod Menu as a dependency in your environment\ndependencies {\n  modImplementation(\"com.terraformersmc:modmenu:${project.modmenu_version}\")\n}\n```\nThen, define the version of Mod Menu you're using in your `gradle.properties`. You can get the latest version number [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/version/latest), but you may need a different version if you're not using the latest Minecraft version. See the [versions page](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions) for a full list of versions.\n\n`gradle.properties`\n```properties\nmodmenu_version=VERSION_NUMBER_HERE\n```\n> If you don't want it in your environment for testing but still want to compile against Mod Menu for using the Java API, you can use `modCompileOnly` instead of `modImplementation` (this will work even if Mod Menu is not updated to the version of Minecraft you're running).\n\n<details>\n<summary>Java API Documentation</summary>\n\n### Getting Started\nTo use the API, implement the ModMenuApi interface on a class and add that as an entry point of type \"modmenu\" in your `fabric.mod.json` like this:\n\n`fabric.mod.json`\n```json\n\"entrypoints\": {\n  \"modmenu\": [ \"com.example.mod.ExampleModMenuApiImpl\" ]\n}\n```\n\n### Mod Config Screens\nMods can provide a Screen factory to provide a custom config screen to open with the config button. Implement the `getModConfigScreenFactory` method in your API implementation to do this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for mods to provide their own config screens. The mod id of the config screen is automagically determined by the source mod container that the entrypoint originated from.\n\n### Provided Config Screens\nMods can provide Screen factories to provide a custom config screens to open with the config buttons for other mods as well. Implement the `getProvidedConfigScreenFactories` method in your API implementation for this.\n\nThe intended use case for this is for a mod like Cloth Config to provide config screens for mods that use its API.\n\n### Modpack Badges\nMods can give other mods the `Modpack` badge by implementing the `attachModpackBadges` method, such as through the following:\n\n```java\n@Override\npublic void attachModpackBadges(Consumer<String> consumer) {\n\tconsumer.accept(\"modmenu\"); // Indicates that 'modmenu' is part of the modpack\n}\n```\n\nNote that 'internal' mods such as Minecraft itself and the mod loader cannot be given the modpack badge, as they are not distributed within a typical modpack.\n\n### Static Helper Methods\n`ModMenuApi` also offers a few helper methods for mods that want to work with Mod Menu better, like making their own Mods buttons.\n\n#### Creating a Mods screen instance\nYou can call this method to get an instance of the Mods screen:\n```java\nScreen createModsScreen(Screen previous)\n```\n\n#### Creating a Mods button `Text`\nYou can call this method to get the Text that would be displayed on a Mod Menu Mods button:\n```java\nText createModsButtonText()\n```\n\n</details>","published":"2020-11-06T05:11:04.725058Z","updated":"2024-08-25T17:06:16.609596Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":12991577,"followers":11639,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.4","1.15.2","1.16.1","1.16.4","1.16.5","21w06a","21w14a","1.17-pre1","1.17","1.17.1","21w37a","21w38a","1.18","1.18.1-pre1","1.18.1-rc1","1.18.1-rc2","1.18.1-rc3","1.18.1","22w03a","22w05a","22w06a","22w07a","1.18.2-pre1","1.18.2-pre2","1.18.2-pre3","1.18.2-rc1","1.18.2","22w15a","22w16b","22w17a","22w18a","22w19a","1.19-pre1","1.19-pre2","1.19-pre3","1.19-pre4","1.19","22w24a","1.19.1-rc1","1.19.1-pre2","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w43a","1.19.3","23w03a","23w05a","23w07a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4-pre2","1.19.4-pre3","1.19.4-pre4","1.19.4-rc1","1.19.4-rc2","1.19.4-rc3","1.19.4","23w12a","23w13a","23w13a_or_b","23w14a","23w16a","23w17a","23w18a","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20-pre3","1.20-pre4","1.20-pre5","1.20-pre6","1.20-pre7","1.20-rc1","1.20","1.20.1-rc1","1.20.1","23w31a","23w32a","23w33a","23w35a","1.20.2-pre1","1.20.2-pre2","1.20.2-pre3","1.20.2-pre4","1.20.2-rc1","1.20.2-rc2","1.20.2","23w40a","23w42a","23w44a","23w45a","23w46a","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","1.21-pre2","1.21-pre3","1.21-pre4","1.21-rc1","1.21","1.21.1-rc1","1.21.1","24w33a","24w34a","24w35a"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["M3KFXLhq","DgzrfgAZ","O90fUm3q","zC13OZD9","7QWIhei3","79rtoAM6","kBofQyu4","TleLdS1A","PqgXyy3N","Mnl0OeFI","pxj9L3Vy","6YvLIUDN","wb5nbuL5","bPE0GIoY","pqlMITZQ","RIf7gcLA","Gz5wa6j2","EDbIonje","wRE7Emzz","mzVbb1XI","bHODZExo","a8bewBQT","NyFB1gry","oQr5VO7q","u955lyFM","E4QBMVtO","c6uDXZX8","bojzkt4w","4Ar2wg0k","G8sCBZ1X","JyL5b75a","GOPQZTVp","Wr4GfZdy","tlM0eBmY","DOitjZ89","XtL1i60M","VaZTuVan","FMqdptUn","aH8qgnVM","9xECQHnM","LVxVja5i","JOqf8AZn","WKj0jgYj","jZQ0G78K","PN4NcBa1","WkUCkcQA","3CD6YUw1","JPP6w2U1","eueI9czw","4JrWqhWw","Ui2loaCY","fw5MM4c4","6f25OJ7w","E4VKK6kQ","y8cYdaYa","GYRoFp1I","Tk7mCRX1","aShj7736","dP3zrFbp","cx9D94fU","pnFEFiHq","ybXxCvz4","NsD1IoUs","oU5qfeR6","2Ys0a7JE","8TOgNwQL","kQDE01D3","3umfHb6R","Gbkn1raO","d86kV6wd","NAs8eiQa","RxrqnH1z","GI1HTA1O","sI3kiPZE","4dReZoTJ","7mdkE3Od","qDXCbEz4","IPLgxPn7","V4hnfgRO","nVxObSbX","7kh2ofyR","eIrlBn1Z","yA8g3pEj","oqeCO757","4LXaG2xg","5qqTBb38","7E8dbVv0","5aw4r6fS","pyDmgV07","jRqFAHRH","4EOA40rU","gSoPJyVn","RtaGQNyd","sXVmzBDB","U31K6311","JYTmttex","pged5sGx","5e62j63G","nM5QaZNo","aMxXwo9x","3gwnUSKz","yjjsLqbS","RdCGzY7B","EuNUYds8","iZRiOnnj","M7LIgtWJ","RTFDnTKf","CtMNOUcV","zv46i3PW","VHzvWfY2","sLzitH81","id0aLmxO","eTCL1uh8","lMqXEzUw","jbNN4rAs","lEkperf6","sMAXpy0X","TwfjidT5","qpKaDJtd","Edgke5GX","tXEHCONL","4EYB2Bxx","fCQyI9Zj","sjtVVlsA","ua8KrvY4","mtTzRMV2","w3icASIi","VOHp29AO","ybV7vGT5","NgnZx44E","9FL4cmP7","KXx8jdVE","YLesFuAc","I7OSH8Gw","jnj30PDT","HLa8flfl","FawTQg29","lJ1xXMce","xhN1IvHi","ixIyiMpO","3ib3Uvvv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/mOgUt4GM/1b6bcdef5a3d92572f517122650716be7ec6458b.webp"},"version":{"id":"ybV7vGT5","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","author_id":"uF4fzWRt","featured":false,"name":"v9.2.0-beta.2
